# Bus_mall

This website is to help researchers to figure out the most popular items in the Bus Mall.

We show 3 product images at a time and ask study participants to pick the one they like the most.

Once they pick one, we show the next 3 images.

We do this for 25 times and show the results of clicks at the end in a chart.

We ensure no duplicate images are shown in a set of images and also between consecutive sets.
